The average cost of laptops is approximately €1134.97, with a price range that starts at €174 and can go up to €6099. Notably, 25% of laptops are priced at €609 or less, while 75% are priced at €1496.50 or below. In terms of RAM allocation, 48% of laptops feature 8 GB of RAM, 28.8% have 4 GB, and 15.5% come with 16 GB. 

The relationship between RAM and price reveals that laptops with 64 GB of RAM are the most expensive on average at €3975, whereas those with 8 GB RAM typically cost around €1184, and 4 GB RAM laptops average €576. Brand influence is significant, with Dell holding a market share of 22.8%, closely followed by Lenovo at 22.7% and HP at 21%.
